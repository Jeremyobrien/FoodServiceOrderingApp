# FoodServiceOrderingApp

This project was designed to hightlight the breadth of .NET Core solutions available. It utilizes the MVC design pattern to implement a highly scalable site for Bethany's Pie Shop.  ASP.NET Core MVC provides robust server side rendering with the aid of Razor Pages for key elements like search.  ASP.NET Core Blazor was also used to provide real-time search functionality and can be accessed via the route "app/search".
