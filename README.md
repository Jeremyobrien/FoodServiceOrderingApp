# FoodServiceOrderingApp

This project was designed to hightlight the breadth of .NET Core solutions available. It utilizes the MVC design pattern to implement a highly scalable web application for Bethany's Pie Shop.  ASP.NET Core MVC provides robust server side rendering with the aid of Razor Pages for checkout.  Leveraging AJAX and a RESTful API, ASP.NET Core Blazor was also used to provide real-time search functionality and can be accessed via the route "app/search".
